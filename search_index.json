"],["the-data.html", "1 The Data 1.1 Aquisition 1.2 Preprocessing", " 1 The Data All the data for this project is sourced from Gapminder. &gt; Gapminder is an independent Swedish foundation with no political, religious or economic affiliations. Gapminder fights devastating misconceptions and promotes a fact-based worldview everyone can understand. Gapminder aggregates information about countries, dating back to the 1800’s. As countries are not static entities but sucuptible to emergence, change, or collapse, the countrys’ identity is established as being what it was for the corresponding year of the recorded statistic. This can lead to multiple country observations being associated with the same logical entity (i.e. Soviet Union and Russia). This non-static property of countries also leads to an increased proportion missing data. Missing data is also attributed to a countries’ lack of tracking said statistic or an inibility for Gapminder to determine it onesself. 1.1 Aquisition The data is hosted on their website in individual CSV files. Unfortunately there is no API to easily acquire mass amounts of data. Therefore, we individually downloaded the CSV’s and hosted them ourselves in the cloud for easy, remote access. 1.2 Preprocessing Data for each variable is individually stored in separate CSV files where rows represent country names and columns represent years. The steps to create a single, comprehensive dataset were as follows: Download the CSV data from the cloud for each variable of interest Melt the year columns in each individual CSV into one column, resulting in a dataset with three columns: country, year, and &lt;variablename&gt; Join all the individual reshaped datasets together by the country and year values to create a single dataset. Strip the leading X from the values in the year column Translate income values with letters into their numerical representations (i.e. 3K to 3000) Cast all columns, except country, into numbers Convert the country column into a factor Remove any rows where there are no relevant statistics recorded for a given country-year pairing. data.raw &lt;- get.raw.dataset() data.melt &lt;- get.melted.dataset(data.raw) Country statisics is oftentimes effectively represented via an approprieatly colored map. In R, this requires that boarders be established for each country using polygons. Miller projected geospacial information for each country was downloaded. This geospacial information included the coordinates for country boundaries, the country name, and its associated contintent and subregion in the world. The geospacial information and the combined dataset from earlier were algorithmically matched and joined by the country column to create a comprehensive dataset. Algorithmic matching was required as the country naming convention was not the same across the two datasets.

To tackle this question, we use the Gapminder dataset, which consists of a variety of data on topics including economics, the environment, and health across the world and over time. As our primary metric, we selected the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient represents income inequality on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to complete equality and 100 corresponds to complete inequality. To begin our analysis, we studied the distribution of income inequality across the world as shown in the map below. Note: All graphs and visualizations in our report are interactive. Scroll over a portion of the plot to obtain additional statistics. Figure 2.1: Average Gini Coefficient The default “range” setting depicts the Gini coefficient on a continuous color scale where countries in red (including South Africa) exhibit high income inequality and countries in blue (including Sweden) exhibit low levels of income inequality. The map also allows one to toggle between the continuous color scale and a discretized color scale by quartiles. This quartile setting reveals that Africa, North America, and South America tend to have the highest income inequality, while Western Europe tends to have the lowest income inequality. We then selected three specific factors of quality of life: 1. education inequality, 2. birth rates, and 3. suicide rates and analyzed them in relation to income inequality. The heatmap below depicts the correlations between our three variables of interest, income per person, and the Gini coefficient. Figure 2.2: Correlation A dark blue signifies a strong positive correlation, a dark red signifies a strong negative correlation, and white represents a weak correlation. Thus, the heatmap introduces some possible associations between our variables: Birth rate is strongly positively correlated with both education and income inequality, Suicide is negatively associated with education inequality, birth rate, and income inequality, and Income is strongly negatively correlated with both birth rate and income inequality. In the next sections, we explore these initial findings in greater depth. First, we focus on how birth rate, education inequality, and suicide relate to the Gini coefficient individually. Then, we continue our exploration of how all the variables connect and influence one other. "],["income-inequality-to-quality-of-life.html", "3 Income Inequality to Quality of Life 3.1 Education 3.2 Birth Rate 3.3 Suicide Rate", " 3 Income Inequality to Quality of Life In this section, we focus on how each quality of life variable is associated with income inequality. 3.1 Education Academic education is thought to be correlated with job opportunity, and by extension potentially higher income. Primary education in particular occurs during a critical time in individuals lives. For some, this early education is more-so a luxury than a necessity. We therefore considered primary school completion rate as an indicator for quality of life and potential income inequality factor. Figure 3.1 illustrates said relationship. Primary school completion is measured as the ratio of new entrants to all age-relevant individuals for the last grade of primary school. This quantification method fails to account for individuals who dropout in the final year of primary education. As inequality is an overarching theme of interest to us, we focused on the primary school completion rate for boys compared to their girl counterparts - dubbed, “Eucation discrepancy.” data.melt$education_discrepancy &lt;- data.melt$education_boys - data.melt$education_girls Figure 3.1: Income Inequality to Education Inequality 3.2 Birth Rate Education inequality and birth rate appeared to be positively correlated in the heatmap shown in the introduction. However, before studying the relationship between these two variables, we first focused on identifying any associations between birth rate and income inequality. In the scatter plot below: each point represents a country, the color of each point represents the corresponding continent, the x-axis represents the birth rate in babies per woman, and the y-axis represents income inequality via the Gini coefficient. Given the knowledge that low income populations tend to have higher birth rates than high income populations, we also used the size of each point to condition on income within each country. Figure 3.2: Income Inequality to Birth Rate All plots are interactive. In the scatter plot above, you can select and deselect components in the plot. Double-clicking on a color in the legend will display only the points of that color, while single-clicking on a color in the legend will add or remove the corresponding points. The scatter plot confirms that there exists a positive correlation between birth rate and income inequality, on average. However, it reveals a few pieces of information that complicated our interpretation: The positive association between birth rate and income inequality does not necessarily hold across a single continent. When we isolate countries from only Africa or only Asia, we observe a negative association (i.e. a higher birth rate tends to be associated with lower income inequality). The distribution of the points in the plot are clustered by continent. The countries with low birth rates tend to have higher incomes than those with high birth rates. Thus, while there is an overall positive association between birth rate and income inequality, points 1 and 2 indicate that cultural and continent-wide variations are present. Likewise, point 3 indicates that income is a potential confounding variable that could be driving the initial trend we observed between birth rate and income inequality. 3.3 Suicide Rate Although not typically associated with income inequality, a disproportionate number of suicides occur in low-to-middle income countries, approximately 75% of the global total. (‘Preventing Suicide: A Global Imperative’,2014,World Health Organization, https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/131056/97892?sequence=1,ISBN 978 92 4 156477 9.) In this section, we will be examining whether or not income inequality has an additional effect on suicide rates. Suicide is a complicated and delicate subject, influenced by a plethora of cultural, religious, and social factors. These factors can have a strong influence on reporting, as individuals or government bodies may under-or-misreport incidents. This may partially explain the gapminder.org dataset’s somewhat odd definition, “Mortality due to self-inflicted injury”, which is notably missing any element of intent. Although outside the scope of this report, this should be borne in mind. The following graph shows suicide rate (per 100,000 people) as a function as GINI, broken down by continent. The three countries in the ‘Seven Seas’ continent are included with the continent of their subregion. data.melt.avg.temp&lt;-data.melt.avg data.melt.avg.temp$continent[data.melt.avg.temp$country==&#39;Maldives&#39;]&lt;-&#39;Asia&#39; data.melt.avg.temp$continent[data.melt.avg.temp$continent==&#39;Seven seas (open ocean)&#39;]&lt;-&#39;Africa&#39; data.melt.avg.temp&lt;-subset(data.melt.avg.temp,is.na(data.melt.avg.temp$continent)==FALSE) region.color.temp&lt;-c(&quot;#E41A1C&quot;, &quot;#377EB8&quot;, &quot;#4DAF4A&quot;, &quot;#984EA3&quot;, &quot;#FF7F00&quot;, &quot;#A65628&quot;) plot&lt;-ggplot2::ggplot(data=data.melt.avg.temp) + ggplot2::geom_point(mapping=ggplot2::aes_string( x=&#39;gini_avg&#39;, y=&#39;suicide_avg&#39;, col=&#39;continent&#39; )) + ggplot2::ggtitle(paste(&#39;Suicide rate to GINI Index, by Continent&#39;,sep=&#39;&#39;)) + ggplot2::xlab(&#39;GINI Index&#39;) + ggplot2::xlim(25,65)+ ggplot2::ylab(&#39;Suicide Rate Per 100,000 People&#39;) + ggplot2::ylim(0,45)+ ggplot2::guides(size=&quot;none&quot;,alpha=&quot;none&quot;) + ggplot2::scale_color_manual(values = region.color.temp,na.translate=FALSE) plot + ggplot2::facet_wrap(~continent,nrow=2,ncol=3) rm(data.melt.avg.temp,region.color.temp) From the above scatterplots, we can see that the relationship between suicide rate and income inequality is inconsistent between continents. Although there are a few subregions where we see strong (or weak) correlations between suicide rate and income inequality, the only continent where we see an appreciable correlation between the two variables is Africa. This correlation holds when making a similar examination of African subregions. data.melt.avg.temp&lt;-subset(data.melt.avg,continent==&#39;Africa&#39;) plot&lt;-ggplot2::ggplot(data=data.melt.avg.temp) + ggplot2::geom_point(mapping=ggplot2::aes_string( x=&#39;gini_avg&#39;, y=&#39;suicide_avg&#39;, col=&#39;subregion&#39; )) + ggplot2::ggtitle(paste(&#39;Suicide rate to GINI Index, by Continent&#39;,sep=&#39;&#39;)) + ggplot2::xlab(&#39;GINI Index&#39;) + ggplot2::xlim(25,65)+ ggplot2::ylab(&#39;Suicide Rate Per 100,000 People&#39;) + ggplot2::ylim(0,45)+ ggplot2::guides(size=&quot;none&quot;,alpha=&quot;none&quot;) #ggplot2::scale_color_manual(values = region.color.temp,na.translate=FALSE) plot + ggplot2::facet_wrap(~subregion,nrow=2,ncol=3) rm(data.melt.avg.temp) Although at this point we are getting down to comparatively small sample sizes, the correlation between suicide rates and income inequality continues to hold for all but the smallest subregion, Southern Africa. Southern Africa, however, is an unusual case that bears some specific attention. Southern Africa contains the two countries in this dataset with the highest suicide rates: Lesotho and Eswatini/Swaziland. Lesotho has an average suicide rate of 61/100,000 over the last 20 years, a value so high that, when included, it makes the y scale nigh on unreadable. Although Lesotho itself has a fairly low GINI, approximately 48, it is unique geographically in that it is landlocked by South Africa. South Africa has a fairly high GINI (63), and an average income of ~12,000, compared to Lesotho’s ~2300. The combined proximity and differences of these two countries suggests that it should not necessarily be taken as a counter-example to the rest of the continent. Eswatini is in a similar, although less exaggerated, position. That said, outside of Africa there is very little consistent relationship between income inequality and suicide rates. "],["quality-of-life-associations.html", "4 Quality of Life Associations", " 4 Quality of Life Associations Up to now we have explored how each quality of life indicator is associated with income inequality. It is equally important to disect how the quality of life indicators interplay with each other. Figure 4.1 illustrates the distribution of each indicator by region. The colored-polygons represent the density for a given value. The box and whisker plot within each colored-polygon depicts the non-outlier quartile values. Note the different axes scales for each indicator. Figure 4.1: Inequality to Quality of Life Figure 4.2: Relationship between Individual Variables This three dimensional scatterplot can be used to examine how each of the three quality of life indicators we examined relate to each other in different regions. For example, to view the relationship between birth rate and educational discrepancy, one could rotate the view to directly ‘above’ the plot, looking straight down the suicide rate axis. Looking from this view, we can see that higher birth rates are correlated to higher educational discrepancy across Africa and Asia, although in the case of Asia most of that correlation is driven by a few central Asian countries (Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq,Pakistan). Europe appears to buck this trend, although the scale, both in terms of birth rate and educational discrepancy, are extremely low by comparison. Suicide rates tend to drop with higher birthrates, and increase around neutral educational discrepancy, although both of these trends appear somewhat exaggerated in this graph due to how each continent clusters. Africa and Asia tend to stretch the educational discrepancy scale, causing Europe and the Americas to look like a dense mass around 0. Combined with Europe’s generally high suicide rate, this makes the correlation appear stronger than it really is. Our analysis thus far has disregarded how the variables of interest and Gini coefficient change over time. The set of line plots below depict the time-related trends in each of the variables from 2000 to the present. Figure 4.3: Quality of Life over Time Initially, we focused on only three continents: Africa, Asia, and Europe. (This view can be obtained by double-clicking on Africa and then single-clicking Asia and Europe.) For the most part, all four variables across the three continents exhibit a downward trend across time. Additionally, in the plots of education discrepancy, birth rate, and Gini coefficient, countries in Africa have the largest magnitudes, those in Europe have the smallest values, and those in Asia are in the middle. We then added North America and South America to our analysis. (This view can be obtained by single-clicking North America and South America.) Other than the suicide rate in South America, the four variables tend to exhibit a downward trend across time for all five continents. The primary observation, however, is how North America and South America have high income inequality relative to what is expected from their low birth rates and low levels of education inequality. Oceania and the Seven Seas consist of a small number of countries and, thus, contain noise that make it hard to identify time-related trends for education inequality. That said, the time-related trends for birth rate and income inequality for these two regions are similar to those observed across the other five continents. Ultimately, we observe that all four variables across each continent have decreased over time, on average and with few exceptions. Additionally, the line plots extend our prior analysis to reveal that the associations between education inequality, birth rate, and income inequality have held over time.
