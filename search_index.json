To tackle this question, we use the Gapminder dataset, which consists of a variety of data on topics including economics, the environment, and health across the world and over time. data.raw &lt;- get.raw.dataset() data.melt &lt;- get.melted.dataset(data.raw) data.melt$education_discrepancy &lt;- data.melt$education_boys - data.melt$education_girls data.melt %&lt;&gt;% append.regions() write.csv(data.melt, &quot;ComprehensiveMeltedData.csv&quot;, row.names=F) As our primary metric, we selected the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient represents income inequality on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to complete equality and 100 corresponds to complete inequality. To begin our analysis, we studied the distribution of income inequality across the world as shown in the map below. Note: All graphs and visualizations in our report are interactive. Scroll over the data within the plots to obtain statistics for each country. ## [1] &quot;Country not found: Channel Islands&quot; ## [2] &quot;Country not found: Cote d&#39;Ivoire&quot; ## [3] &quot;Country not found: Eswatini&quot; ## [4] &quot;Country not found: Gibraltar&quot; ## [5] &quot;Country not found: Holy See&quot; ## [6] &quot;Country not found: Macao, China&quot; ## [7] &quot;Country not found: Netherlands Antilles&quot; ## [8] &quot;Country not found: Sint Maarten (Dutch part)&quot; ## [9] &quot;Country not found: Tuvalu&quot; Figure 1.1: Average Gini Coefficient The default “range” setting depicts the Gini coefficient on a continuous color scale where countries in red (including South Africa) exhibit high income inequality and countries in blue (including Sweden) exhibit low levels of income inequality. The map also allows one to toggle between the continuous color scale and a discretized color scale by quartiles. This quartile setting reveals that Africa, North America, and South America tend to have the highest income inequality, while Western Europe tends to have the lowest income inequality. We then selected three specific factors of quality of life: 1. education, 2. birth, and 3. suicide and analyzed them in relation to income inequality. The heatmap below depicts the correlations between our three variables of interest, income per person, and the Gini coefficient. Figure 1.2: Correlation A dark blue signifies a strong positive correlation, a dark red signifies a strong negative correlation, and white represents a weak correlation. Thus, the heatmap introduces some possible associations between our variables: Birth rate is strongly positively correlated with both education and income inequality, Suicide is negatively associated with education inequality, birth rate, and income inequality, and Income is strongly negatively correlated with both birth rate and income inequality. In the next sections, we explore these initial findings in greater depth. First, we focus on how birth rate, education inequality, and suicide relate to the Gini coefficient individually. Then, we continue our exploration of how all the variables connect and influence one other. "],["income-inequality-to-quality-of-life.html", "2 Income Inequality to Quality of Life 2.1 Education 2.2 Birth Rate 2.3 Suicide Rate", " 2 Income Inequality to Quality of Life In this section, we focus on how each quality of life variable is associated with income inequality. 2.1 Education Academic education is thought to be correlated with job opportunity, and by extension potentially higher income. Primary education in particular occurs during a critical time in individuals lives. For some, this early education is more-so a luxury than a necessity. We therefore considered primary school completion rate as an indicator for quality of life and potential income inequality factor. Figure 2.1 illustrates said relationship. Primary school completion is measured as the ratio of new entrants to all age-relevant individuals for the last grade of primary school. This quantification method fails to account for individuals who dropout in the final year of primary education. As inequality is an overarching theme of interest to us, we focused on the primary school completion rate for boys compared to their girl counterparts - dubbed, “Eucation discrepancy.” Figure 2.1: Income Inequality to Education Inequality 2.2 Birth Rate Education inequality and birth rate appeared to be positively correlated in the heatmap shown in the intro section. However, before studying the relationship between those two variables, we first focused on identifying any associations between birth rate and income inequality. In the scatter plot below: each point represents a country, the color of each point represents the corresponding continent, the x-axis represents the birth rate in babies per woman, and the y-axis represents income inequality via the Gini coefficient. Given the knowledge that low income populations tend to have higher birth rates than high income populations, we also used the size of each point to condition on income within each country. All plots are interactive. In the scatter plot below, you can select and deselect components in the plot. Double-clicking on a color in the legend will display only the points of that color, while single-clicking on a color in the legend will add or remove the corresponding points. Figure 2.2: Income Inequality to Birth Rate The scatter plot confirms that there exists a positive correlation between birth rate and income inequality, on average. However, it reveals a few pieces of information that complicated our interpretation: The positive association between birth rate and income inequality does not necessarily hold across a single continent. When we isolate countries from only Africa or only Asia, we observe a negative association (i.e. a higher birth rate tends to be associated with lower income inequality). The distribution of the points in the plot are clustered by continent. The countries with low birth rates tend to have higher incomes than those with high birth rates. Thus, while there is an overall positive association between birth rate and income inequality, points 1 and 2 indicate that cultural and continent-wide variations are present. Likewise, point 3 indicates that income is a potential confounding variable that could be driving the initial trend we observed between birth rate and income inequality. 2.3 Suicide Rate Figure 2.3: Income Inequality to Suicide Rate "],["quality-of-life-associations.html", "3 Quality of Life Associations", " 3 Quality of Life Associations Up to now we have explored how each quality of life indicator is associated with income inequality. It is equally important to disect how the quality of life indicators interplay with eachother. fig&lt;-data.melt.avg %&gt;% dplyr::mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2)%&gt;% plotly::plot_ly( x=~education_discrepancy_avg,y=~babies_per_woman_avg,z=~suicide_avg, color=~continent,colors=region.color,alpha=.8, text=~country, hovertemplate=paste(&#39;%{x}&#39;,&#39;%{text}&#39;,&#39;GINI:%{y}&#39;,&#39;SR:%{z}&#39;,sep=&#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39;)) fig &lt;- fig %&gt;% plotly::add_markers() fig &lt;- fig %&gt;% plotly::layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = &#39;Education Discrepancy&#39;), yaxis = list(title = &#39;Babies per Woman&#39;), zaxis = list(title = &#39;Suicide Rate&#39;))) fig &lt;- fig %&gt;% plotly::layout(title=&quot;Suicide Rate by GINI Index&quot;, showlegend = T) fig Figure 3.1 illustrates the distribution of each indicator by region.
