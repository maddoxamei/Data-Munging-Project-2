Primary education in particular occurs during a critical time in individuals lives. For some, this early education is more-so a luxury than a necessity. We therefore considered primary school completion rate as an indicator for quality of life and potential income inequality factor. Figure 2.2 illustrates said relationship. Primary school completion is measured as the ratio of new entrants to all age-relevant individuals for the last grade of primary school. This quantification method fails to account for individuals who dropout in the final year of primary education. As inequality is an overarching theme of interest to us, we focused on the primary school completion rate for boys compared to their girl counterparts - dubbed, “Eucation discrepancy.” Figure 2.2: Income Inequality to Education Inequality 2.2 Birth Rate Figure 2.3: Income Inequality to Birth Rate "],["quality-of-life-associations.html", "3 Quality of Life Associations", " 3 Quality of Life Associations Up to now we have explored how each quality of life indicator is associated with income inequality. It is equally important to disect how the quality of life indicators interplay with eachother. Figure 3.1 illustrates the distribution of each indicator by region. The colored-polygons represent the density for a given value. The box and whisker plot within each colored-polygon depicts the non-outlier quartile values. Note the different axes scales for each indicator.
